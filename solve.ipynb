I need to guide SymPy towards the standard form by directly substituting the simplified terms based on the E < V0 assumption. Specifically, I will substitute `sqrt(-E + V0)` with `sp.I * sp.sqrt(E - V0)` where `E-V0` is negative, or more appropriately, substitute `sqrt(-E + V0)` with `sp.sqrt(V0 - E)` and explicitly tell SymPy that `V0 - E` is positive under our assumption. Let's retry by making the substitution `sqrt(-E + V0)` -> `sqrt(V0 - E)` and then applying simplification with the assumption `V0 - E > 0`.\n",

        "*   **Dependency on Electron Energy (E):**\n",
        "    *   The term $\\sqrt{V_0 - E}$ is present in the exponent. As $E$ increases (approaching $V_0$), $V_0 - E$ decreases, and thus $\\sqrt{V_0 - E}$ decreases. This leads to a smaller negative argument in the exponential terms (like $e^{-2\\alpha L}$ where $\\alpha \\propto \\sqrt{V_0 - E}$), causing the exponential term to become larger.\n",
        "    *   Therefore, as the electron energy $E$ increases (while still being less than $V_0$), the tunneling probability $T$ is expected to **increase**. This is physically intuitive: a higher energy electron has a greater chance of tunneling through a barrier of fixed height.\n",
        "    *   The pre-exponential factors in the full symbolic expression also depend on $E$ and $V_0$, contributing to the overall dependency in a more complex way than the simple exponential approximation.\n",

        "*   **Dependency on Barrier Height (V0):**\n",
        "    *   The term $\\sqrt{V_0 - E}$ is also present in the exponent. As $V_0$ increases (for a fixed $E < V_0$), $V_0 - E$ increases, and thus $\\sqrt{V_0 - E}$ increases. This leads to a larger negative argument in the exponential terms, causing the exponential term to become smaller.\n",
        "    *   Therefore, as the barrier height $V_0$ increases (for a fixed $E < V_0$), the tunneling probability $T$ is expected to **decrease**. This is also physically intuitive: a taller barrier is harder for an electron to tunnel through.\n",
        "    *   Similar to the dependency on $E$, the pre-exponential factors also influence the exact relationship, but the dominant effect comes from the exponential term.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the symbolic expression confirms the expected physical behavior: tunneling probability increases with increasing electron energy (for $E < V_0$) and decreases with increasing barrier height. The complexity of the full expression captures more subtle effects like reflections compared to the simple exponential approximation."
